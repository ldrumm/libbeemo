Any Lua source in this directory will be embedded into the interpreter as part of the build.

As with most programming systems, it is advisable to limit the use of globals where possible.
Use of Lua's `require` import mechanism is not supported for scripts in this directory as they
must always be available to the embedded source, and we don't yet have a mechanism to make that happen during the build.

The general advice (while the project is still discovering the best approach at least) is to
add your functions the `dsp` global table, or provide your packages as a table in the global namespace when it makes sense to do so.
